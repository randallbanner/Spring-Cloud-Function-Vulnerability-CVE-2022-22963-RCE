Description:
Script creates shell.sh in current directory, with a simple bash reverse shell
one-liner. Then starts a webserver to serve it to the victim via wget (output in 
/dev/shm folder), next it makes shell.sh executable and finally runs it.

Don't forget to start Netcat before running script!
